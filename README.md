This project, built as part of my learning experience at Brainster Front-end Academy, focuses on providing users with an intuitive way to filter and navigate through available courses. It allowed me to create a multi-page application, applying Sass for styling, and explore front-end development concepts for the first time. One of the key highlights of the project was the implementation of the `filter()` method and form validation, which significantly improved both user interaction and data accuracy.

## Features

- **Filtering Functionality**:  
  Developed a filtering system that allows users to filter courses or products based on three distinct themes, enhancing the search experience and helping users find relevant content quickly.

- **Form Validation**:  
  Integrated real-time form validation, ensuring that users can only submit valid data. This feature helps prevent errors and improves overall user experience by providing immediate feedback on incorrect inputs.

- **User-friendly Navigation**:  
  Designed and implemented a clear and intuitive navigation structure, enabling easy access to different sections of the site, improving overall accessibility and usability.
